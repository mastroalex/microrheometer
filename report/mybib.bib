	abstract = {A mathematical model of mechanical ventilator describes its behavior during artificial ventilation. This paper purposes to create and simulate Mathematical Model (MM) of Pressure Controlled Ventilator (PCV) signal. This MM represents the respiratory activities and an important controlled parameter during mechanical ventilation—Positive End Expiration Pressure (PEEP). The MM is expressed and modelled using periodic functions with inequalities to control the beginning of inspiration and expiration durations. The created MM of PCV signal is combined with an existing multi compartmental model of respiratory system that is modified and developed in the internal parameters—compliances (C) to test created MM. The created MM and model of respiratory system are constructed and simulated using Simulink package in MATLAB platform. The obtained simulator of mechnical ventilation system could potentially represent the pressure signal of PVC as a complete respiratory cycle and continuance waveform. This simulator is also able to reflect a respiratory mechanic by changing some input variables such as inspiration pressure (IP), PEEP and C, which are monitored in volume, flow, pressure and PV loop waveforms. The obtained simulator has provided a simple environment for testing and monitoring PCV signal and other parameters (volume, flow and dynamic compliance) during artificial ventilation. Furthermore, the simulator may be used for studying in the laboratory and training ventilator’s operators.},

	abstract = {Most clinicians pay attention to tidal volume and airway pressures and their curves during mechanical ventilation. On the other hand, inspiratory–expiratory flow curves also provide a plethora of information, but much less attention is paid to them. Flow curves chronologically show the velocity and direction of inspiration and expiration and are influenced by the respiratory mechanics, the patient’s effort, and the mode of ventilation and its settings. When the ventilator setting does not synchronize with the patient’s respiratory pattern, the patient can easily have worsening breathing effort, patient–ventilator asynchrony, which can lead to prolonged ventilator support or lung injury. The information provided by the flow curves during mechanical ventilation, such as respiratory mechanics, the patient’s effort, and patient–ventilator interactions, are very helpful when adjusting the ventilator setting. If clinicians can monitor and assess the flow curves information appropriately, it can be a useful diagnostic and therapeutic tool at the bedside. There may be association between inspiratory effort and flow, and this may further guide us, especially in the weaning process and when patients are not synchronizing with the ventilator. In this review, we try to gather information about “flow” that is scattered around in the literature and textbooks in one place. We will summarize the different flow waveforms utilized in commonly used ventilator modes with their advantages and disadvantages, information gained by the flow curves (i.e., flow-time, flow-volume, and flow-pressure), how to detect and manage asynchronies, and some ideas for future uses. Flow waveforms shapes and patterns are very beneficial for the management of patients undergoing mechanical ventilatory support. Attention to those waveforms can potentially improve patient outcomes. Clinicians should be familiar with this information and how to act upon them.},

	, 
	This paper describes a new design of microfluidic impedance cytometer enabling accurate characterization of particles without the need for focusing. The approach uses multiple pairs of electrodes to measure the transit time of particles through the device in two simultaneous different current measurements, a transverse (top to bottom) current and an oblique current. This gives a new metric that can be used to estimate the vertical position of the particle trajectory through the microchannel. This parameter effectively compensates for the non-uniform electric field in the channel that is an unavoidable consequence of the use of planar parallel facing electrodes. The new technique is explained and validated using numerical modelling. Impedance data for 5, 6 and 7 μm particles are collected and compared with simulations. The method gives excellent coefficient of variation in (electrical) radius of particles of 1\% for a sheathless configuration.},

	abstract = {A new microfluidic impedance cytometer chip is demonstrated, giving high quality impedance signals without the need for any particle focusing.
	, 
	This paper describes a new design of microfluidic impedance cytometer enabling accurate characterization of particles without the need for focusing. The approach uses multiple pairs of electrodes to measure the transit time of particles through the device in two simultaneous different current measurements, a transverse (top to bottom) current and an oblique current. This gives a new metric that can be used to estimate the vertical position of the particle trajectory through the microchannel. This parameter effectively compensates for the non-uniform electric field in the channel that is an unavoidable consequence of the use of planar parallel facing electrodes. The new technique is explained and validated using numerical modelling. Impedance data for 5, 6 and 7 μm particles are collected and compared with simulations. The method gives excellent coefficient of variation in (electrical) radius of particles of 1\% for a sheathless configuration.},

	abstract = {The hope was recently expressed (Hill 1937, p. 116) that with the development of a more accurate and rapid technique for muscle heat measurement, a much more consistent picture might emerge of the energy relations of muscles shortening (or lengthening) and doing positive (or negative) work. This hope has been realized, and some astonishingly simple and accurate relations have been found, relations, moreover, which (among other things) determine the effect of load on speed of shortening, allow the form of the isometric contraction to be predicted, and are the basis of the so-called “visco-elasticity” of skeletal muscle. This paper is divided into three parts. In Part I further developments of the technique are described: everything has depended on the technique, so no apology is needed for a rather full description of it and of the precautions necessary. In Part II the results themselves are described and discussed. In Part III the “visco-elastic” properties of active muscle are shown to be a consequence of the properties described in Part II.},

	abstract = {Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is characterized by a progressive failure of pancreatic -cell function (BCF) with insulin resistance. Once insulin over-secretion can no longer compensate for the degree of insulin resistance, hyperglycemia becomes clinically significant and deterioration of residual -cell reserve accelerates. This pathophysiology has important therapeutic implications. Ideally, therapy should address the underlying pathology and should be started early along the spectrum of decreasing glucose tolerance in order to prevent or slow -cell failure and reverse insulin resistance. The development of an optimal treatment strategy for each patient requires accurate diagnostic tools for evaluating the underlying state of glucose tolerance. This review focuses on the most widely used methods for measuring BCF within the context of insulin resistance and includes examples of their use in prediabetes and T2DM, with an emphasis on the most recent therapeutic options (dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists). Methods of BCF measurement include the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA); oral glucose tolerance tests, intravenous glucose tolerance tests (IVGTT), and meal tolerance tests; and the hyperglycemic clamp procedure. To provide a meaningful evaluation of BCF, it is necessary to interpret all observations within the context of insulin resistance. Therefore, this review also discusses methods utilized to quantitate insulin-dependent glucose metabolism, such as the IVGTT and the euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp procedures. In addition, an example is presented of a mathematical modeling approach that can use data from BCF measurements to develop a better understanding of BCF behavior and the overall status of glucose tolerance.},

Glucose was injected into conscious dogs at 100, 200, or 300 mg/kg. The measured time course of insulin was regarded as the "input," and the falling glucose concentration as the "output" of the physiological system storing and using glucose. Seven mathematical models of glucose uptake were compared to identify the representation most capable of simulating glucose disappearance. One specific nonlinear model was superior in that it 1) predicted the time course of glucose after glucose injection, 2) had four parameters that could be precisely estimated, and 3) described individual experiments with similar parameter values. Insulin sensitivity index (SI), defined as the dependence of fractional glucose disappearance on plasma insulin, was the ratio of two parameters of the chosen model and could be estimated with good reproducibility from the 300 mg/kg injection experiments (SI = 7.00 X 10(-4) +/- 24\% (coefficient of variation) min-1/(microU/ml) (n = 8)). Thus, from a single glucose injection it is possible to obtain a quantitative index of insulin sensitivity that may have clinical applicability.},

Ideally, in silico simulations can quantitatively predict the impact of formulation and processing parameters on the resulting drug release kinetics. The aim of this article is to give an overview on the current state of the art of modeling drug release from delivery systems, which are predominantly controlled by diffusional mass transport. The inner structure of the device, the ratio “initial drug concentration:drug solubility” as well as the device geometry determine which type of mathematical equation must be applied. A straightforward “road map” is given, explaining how to identify the appropriate equation for a particular type of drug delivery system. The respective equations for a broad range of devices are indicated, including reservoir and matrix systems, exhibiting or not an initial excess of drug and the geometry of slabs, spheres and cylinders. The assumptions the models are based on as well as their limitations are pointed out. Practical examples illustrate the usefulness of mathematical modeling of diffusion controlled drug delivery. Due to the advances in information technology the importance of in silico optimization of advanced drug delivery systems can be expected to signiﬁcantly increase in the future.},

	abstract = {Review of chip designs and data analytics to stratify heterogeneity in cellular systems               via               microfluidic impedance cytometry.                        ,                             The biophysical analysis of single-cells by microfluidic impedance cytometry is emerging as a label-free and high-throughput means to stratify the heterogeneity of cellular systems based on their electrophysiology. Emerging applications range from fundamental life-science and drug assessment research to point-of-care diagnostics and precision medicine. Recently, novel chip designs and data analytic strategies are laying the foundation for multiparametric cell characterization and subpopulation distinction, which are essential to understand biological function, follow disease progression and monitor cell behaviour in microsystems. In this tutorial review, we present a comparative survey of the approaches to elucidate cellular and subcellular features from impedance cytometry data, covering the related subjects of device design, data analytics (               i.e.               , signal processing, dielectric modelling, population clustering), and phenotyping applications. We give special emphasis to the exciting recent developments of the technique (timeframe 2017–2020) and provide our perspective on future challenges and directions. Its synergistic application with microfluidic separation, sensor science and machine learning can form an essential toolkit for label-free quantification and isolation of subpopulations to stratify heterogeneous biosystems.},

	abstract = {Biological materials such as extracellular matrix scaffolds, cancer cells, and tissues are often assumed to respond elastically for simplicity; the viscoelastic response is quite commonly ignored. Extracellular matrix mechanics including the viscoelasticity has turned out to be a key feature of cellular behavior and the entire shape and function of healthy and diseased tissues, such as cancer. The interference of cells with their local microenvironment and the interaction among different cell types relies both on the mechanical phenotype of each involved element. However, there is still not yet clearly understood how viscoelasticity alters the functional phenotype of the tumor extracellular matrix environment. Especially the biophysical technologies are still under ongoing improvement and further development. In addition, the effect of matrix mechanics in the progression of cancer is the subject of discussion. Hence, the topic of this review is especially attractive to collect the existing endeavors to characterize the viscoelastic features of tumor extracellular matrices and to briefly highlight the present frontiers in cancer progression and escape of cancers from therapy. Finally, this review article illustrates the importance of the tumor extracellular matrix mechano-phenotype, including the phenomenon viscoelasticity in identifying, characterizing, and treating specific cancer types.},
