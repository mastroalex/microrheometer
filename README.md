Characterization of the mechanical properties of the cell is of great importance to characterize its biological state.

Among the different techniques the microreometer allows to characterize the viscoelastic properties. We consider a measurement experiment of a large paramagnetic microreometer and the experimental data to analyze the behavior of a mechanical cell model with lumped parameters.

This model is described by the parallel of a Maxwell body with an elastic stiffness to which a series damper is added to reduce the discrepancy with the experimental data.

The viscoelastic constants estimated by the lumped-parameter model are indicative of the properties of the whole cell and not of the individual constituents such as membrane, cytoskeleton or cytoplasm, for which a different model would be required.


The equivalent circuit model for a parallel electrode impedance cytometer is analyzed together with Maxwell's theory of homogenization of mixtures. It deals with both a modeling single and double shell.

The results show that even small errors in the estimation of the parameters lead to variations in the model predictions. Furthermore, the possibility of differentiating is evident from the modeled signal different biological states at different analysis frequencies.
